## 📘 Overview

Time series data is everywhere — stock prices, sales numbers, weather trends, and more.  
This repository is designed to help you **understand, preprocess, visualize, and forecast** such data effectively.

### Key Learning Goals:
- Understand **time series concepts** (trend, seasonality, noise)
- Perform **data cleaning, resampling, and feature engineering**
- Apply **classical forecasting models** (ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing)
- Experiment with **modern forecasting approaches** (Prophet, LSTM, XGBoost)
- Evaluate models using **error metrics** like RMSE, MAE, MAPE
- Visualize trends and predictions clearly
